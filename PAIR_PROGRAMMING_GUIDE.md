1. Write your commit message
2. Add a blank line
3. Add: `Co-authored-by: Wasuda Sandaruvan <wasudasandaruvan@example.com>`

### Method 3: Git Configuration
```bash

## üìä Benefits of Co-Authored Commits

1. **GitHub Recognition**: Both contributors appear in repository insights
2. **Contribution Tracking**: Proper credit for collaborative work
3. **Portfolio Evidence**: Shows pair programming experience
4. **Team Transparency**: Clear collaboration history

## üéâ Pair Programming Session Workflow

1. **Start Session**: Plan what to work on together
2. **Switch Roles**: Driver and navigator every 15-30 minutes
3. **Document Decisions**: Include reasoning in commit messages
4. **Review Together**: Both approve before committing
5. **Commit with Co-Author**: Use proper attribution format
