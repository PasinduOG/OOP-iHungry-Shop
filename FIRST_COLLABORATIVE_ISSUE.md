# [FEATURE] Implement JavaDoc Documentation and Code Review Session

## ðŸš€ Feature Enhancement Request

### Description
Add comprehensive JavaDoc documentation to all public methods and conduct a collaborative code review session to improve code quality and establish pair programming workflow.

### Problem Statement
The current codebase lacks proper documentation, making it harder for new contributors to understand the code structure and functionality. Additionally, we need to establish a collaborative development workflow between @PasinduOG and @wasudasandaruvan.

### Proposed Solution
1. Add JavaDoc comments to all public methods in both `Burger` and `IHungry` classes
2. Conduct a pair programming session to review existing code
3. Identify and document areas for optimization
4. Establish code review standards for future collaboration

### Implementation Details
- [x] Which class/method needs to be modified?
  - `Burger` class: All getters, setters, and constructors
  - `IHungry` class: All public methods (`placeOrder()`, `searchBestCustomer()`, etc.)
- [x] What new methods might be needed?
  - No new methods, only documentation enhancement
- [x] Any dependencies or prerequisites?
  - Basic understanding of JavaDoc syntax
  - Collaborative session planning

### Expected Behavior
After implementation:
- All public methods should have clear JavaDoc documentation
- Code should be more maintainable and understandable
- Pair programming workflow should be established
- Code review standards should be documented

### Additional Context
This is the first collaborative task to kickstart the pair programming initiative. It will help both developers understand the codebase thoroughly and establish working patterns.

### Assignee Preference
- [x] @PasinduOG
- [x] @wasudasandaruvan
- [x] Either collaborator

### Priority
- [x] High (Critical functionality)
- [ ] Medium (Important improvement)
- [ ] Low (Nice to have)
