## Getting Started for @wasudasandaruvan

### 1. Repository Access
To collaborate on this project, you'll need to:

1. **Fork the repository** or get added as a collaborator
2. **Clone your fork** or the main repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PasinduOG/OOP-iHungry-Shop.git
   cd OOP-iHungry-Shop
   ```

3. **Set up remote repositories**:
   ```bash
   # If you forked the repo, add the upstream remote
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/PasinduOG/OOP-iHungry-Shop.git
   
   # Verify remotes
   git remote -v
   ```

### 2. Development Workflow

#### For Collaborative Development:
```bash
# 1. Always start with the latest code
git checkout master
git pull origin master

# 2. Create a new feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# 3. Make your changes
# Edit files, add features, fix bugs

# 4. Test your changes
javac IHungry.java
java IHungry

# 5. Commit your changes
git add .
git commit -m "Add: descriptive message about your changes"

# 6. Push to your branch
git push origin feature/your-feature-name

# 7. Create a Pull Request on GitHub
```

### 3. Suggested Task Distribution

#### Phase 1: Code Review & Understanding
- [ ] Review current codebase structure
- [ ] Test all existing features
- [ ] Document any bugs or improvements found
- [ ] Create issues for identified improvements

#### Phase 2: Enhancement Tasks

**@wasudasandaruvan could focus on:**
- [ ] Input validation improvements
- [ ] User interface enhancements
- [ ] Error handling optimization
- [ ] Code documentation (JavaDoc comments)

**@PasinduOG could focus on:**
- [ ] Core algorithm optimizations
- [ ] New feature implementations
- [ ] Architecture improvements
- [ ] Performance optimizations

#### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- [ ] Data persistence (file I/O)
- [ ] Enhanced reporting features
- [ ] Configuration management
- [ ] Unit testing implementation

### 4. Code Standards & Guidelines

#### Java Coding Standards:
- Use meaningful variable and method names
- Follow camelCase naming convention
- Add JavaDoc comments for public methods
- Keep methods focused and single-purpose
- Use consistent indentation (4 spaces)

#### Git Commit Messages:
```
Add: new feature or functionality
Fix: bug fixes
Update: modifications to existing features
Refactor: code restructuring without functional changes
Docs: documentation updates
Test: adding or updating tests
```

#### Code Review Process:
1. Create descriptive pull requests
2. Include screenshots for UI changes
3. Test changes before submitting PR
4. Request review from the other collaborator
5. Address feedback before merging

### 5. Communication Channels

#### GitHub Integration:
- **Issues**: For bug reports and feature requests
- **Pull Requests**: For code reviews and discussions
- **Projects**: For task tracking and project management
- **Discussions**: For general project conversations

#### Development Sync:
- Regular check-ins to discuss progress
- Pair programming sessions for complex features
- Code review sessions for quality assurance
